# RaspuinoPy

##
Short example of how to get a raspberry pi and an arduino to communicate via Serial. Just make the arduino send and "h" perdiocally at a 9600 Baudrate
and connect to a USB port on the Raspbi. The library [pySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html) is also needed.
